      <p>
        Pål explained to us that the purpose of the website is to attract
        sponsors to further his and his 3 sons carreers as
        shooting athletes. Our goal is to structure and
        prioritize the information so that the accomplishments of the athletes
        become clear and therefore attract potential sponsors.

        The intended audience for this webpage is going to be mainly sponsors
        but also the general public who are eager to know more about this
        families shooting ability. For the sponsors it would be necessary to
        see if the different members of the Hembre family has achieved
        something remarkable, like gotten medals or broken records. This can be
        showed by statistics and also videos. For the general public the pictures,
        videos and statistics seem interesting.

      <h3 id="content">Content </h3>

      <p>
        Hereunder we will explain what is going to be displayed on each page of the website. There will be 21 individual pages in total, but some of these are bundled together because they have the same layout. The websites color palette is going to
        stay consistent throughout most of the pages as we opted for cold” colors in the background, and some warmer colors in the foreground, so that clickables and other more important aspects pop more out of the page.
      </p>
      <h3> Homepage - index.html </h3>
      <p>
        The homepage will be the first webpage the user sees. Therefore, we want to make it easy and intuitive for the user to navigate with a navigation bar. The navigation bar will be located on the top of the page and will contain the following
        buttons: logo, om oss (about us), kontakt oss (contact us), sponsorer (sponsors) and utøvere (athletes). Each button will take the user to a different page and when users hover over the “utøvere”-button they will get a dropdown menu with
        links to the underlying pages for each individual athlete. The navigation bar is the same on all the following pages and the logo will be usable as a home button for easy backtracking to the homepage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our client wants the homepage to include pictures, videos, news, sponsors and supporting players. Because of that, the homepage is going to be split vertically into three sections. The far left of the page will feature the logos of Team
        Hembres´ sponsors, which will also be clickable links that bring the user to the sponsors´ own websites. The far right of the page will include a list of all of Team Hemres´supporting players. As for the middle, we want to include a lot of
        interesting news about Team Hembre, and we believe that the most space-efficient way to do that is with an interactive slideshow where the user can choose to go back and forth. Underneath this slideshow we will have a section with pictures
        of all the 4 athletes and their respective names. The user will be able to click on these pictures for easy navigation to each individual athletes’ personal site. Right above the footer there will be another slideshow with different videos
        of Team Hembre participating in events or other related material.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like the navigation bar, the footer will be the same for every page. The footer consists of the logo, links to the individual athletes, the “kontakt oss”-button, Pål Hembres´ personal contact information and a link to the national
        shooting statistics.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/index.png" alt="">
      <h3> Sponsorer - sponsors.html </h3>
      <p>
        The sponsor page will feature more information on the teams´sponsors. This page is meant to market the sponsors, as well as to thank them for their support. At the top of the page their logos will be featured and users who click on the logos
        will be taken further down on the page where more information about the sponsor is given. Here the page will have a link to external sponsor-pages as well. This page will also veer a little from the color pallet chosen for the other pages,
        which we believe will be a nice mix up, and will differentiate the page a little since it will be the only page not focused on Team Hembre.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/sponsor.png" alt="">


      <h3> Nyheter – news.html </h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of the news page will be to update the user of recent happenings, be it competitive results or other interesting developments at Team Hembre. At the top of this page we will have the same slideshow as seen on the homepage, but it
        will however be possible to post news stories with a little more context further down the page.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/nyheter.png" alt="">


      <h3> Om oss – about.html </h3>
      <p>
        The about us page will consist mostly of information about Team Hembre as a whole, to give the user some backstory on how this organization came to be. A team photo will be located at the top of the page and below that there will be a box
        that displays Team Hembres´ merits collectively. Further down there will be some informational text about the entire organization, as well as some short texts that serves as an introduction to each member individually.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/om.png" alt="">


      <h3> Kontakt oss - contact.html </h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this page is mainly to be a way for potential sponsors or supporting players to get in touch with the team. The page will give the user the option to leave a message by filling in a small form. Underneath the form there will be
        information on where the team practices. Here we will put the address and phone number, as well as a map showing the location of the training facilities.
        Right over the footer we will also show the sponsors´ logos again.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/kontakt.png" alt="">

      <h3> Utøvere </h3>
      <p>
        - paal.html
        - mattis.html
        - ludvik.html
        - tim_leo.html
      </p>
      <p>
        The individual pages for each athlete will have the same layout. These pages are meant to give the user more information about each of the athletes and highlight their accomplishments in the sport. On the top-left side of the page we will
        put a picture of the athlete in question, and on the top-right there will be more generic information like age and years of experience. Here we will also put a dropdown menu that shows a selection of different events the athlete has
        participated in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further down on the page we will have a couple of boxes, showing the athletes merits and their personal best scores. These pages will also contain links to the respective athletes’ best competitive result, their average score and number of
        starts. These pages will only be showing one table that covers the whole page, so while they will be individual to each athlete, they will still have the exact same layout.
      </p>

        For this project we want a real client because that can give us some
        specific criterias and also motivate us by having the specific
        objective of helping someone that is in actual need of a website. As
        it happens, one of our group members know someone who has prevously
        created his own website, but is looking for an upgrade. We have
        therefore settled on our real client, Pål Hembre.
      </p>

      <p class="infoP">

        Pål Hembre and his three sons are active in competitive pistol
        shooting, where all of them have impressive results to show to. Pål
        has previously created a website that showcases their accomplishments
        and competition statistics in said sport. However, he has recently
        suggested that his website is in need of an upgrade and that he is
        looking for someone to give it a slightly cleaner and professional
        look. We se this as the perfect opportunity to create a new,
        functional and impressive website that will actually be of use to our
        client.

        /*
        We had a short meeting with Pål where we talked about what he wanted
        to use the website for and how he wanted it to function. During this
        meeting we outlined our own timeframe and restrictions for the project
        as to give our client realistic expectations for the final product.
        Pål explained to us that the purpose of the website is to attract
        sponsors to further his and his aforementioned sons carreers as
        athletes.
        */
      </p>
      <p class="infoP">
        /*
        The information and data the client provided can in itself be quite
        confusing as there are a lot of statistics from various championships
        and other competitions. Our goal is therefore to structure and
        prioritize the information so that the accomplishments of the athletes
        become clear and therefore attract potential sponsors. A description
        of the athletes in an "about", for example, will also be included to
        add a more personal feel, and therefore be more convincing.

        */

      <p class="infoP">
        The intended audience for this webpage is going to be mainly sponsors
        but also the general public who are eager to know more about this
        families shooting ability. For the sponsors it would be necessary to
        see if the different members of the Hembre family has achieved
        soething remarkable, like gotten medals or broken records. This can be
        showed by statistics and also videos. There could be in there interest
        to also look at what other companies and partners they have to know if
        they are really proffesional. For the general public the pictures,
        videos and statistics seem interesting.

        We choose a professional look because we want the website tho look as formal
        as possible.
        And we also focused especially that the website where very easy to navigate
        to because the audience is very wide and there are many elderly
        people that doesn't know computers well.
        So we focused on having an easily navigatable navigation-bar width some
        dropdown-elements so you can navigate where you want from every page since
        every pages have a navigation-bar.
      </p>
      <p class="infoP">
          in the navigation-bar there is a tab with athletes called "utøvere" width a dropdownmenu
          thath showcases the athletes and i you hover over the athletes a new dropdownmenu
          apears so if you want to go right to the statistics if your desire source
      </p>
      <p class="infoP">
          there is also a tab that leads you to the news called "nyheter".
          And one tab that leads you to the about us called "om oss"
          And one tab that leads you to the kontack us called "kontakt oss"
      </p>
      <p class="infoP">
          the layout of the navbar width the dropdownmenu and footer looks like this on the main page and the other pages on
          a computer

      <img src="layout-pc.jpg" alt="picture of the nav and footer layout on pc">
      <p class="infoP">
        and the layout of the navbar width the dropdownmenu and footer looks like this on the main page and the other pages on
        a mobile/small devieces, width no hover but a clickable dropdownmenu and also the menu is
        hidden from start and you have to click on it to initiate and it will show in a column, instead of a row as the pc-version does.
        This is to make it easier and more clean on the mobile.

        <p>
          Pål explained to us that the purpose of the website is to attract
          sponsors to further his and his 3 sons carreers as shooting athletes.
          Our goal is to structure and prioritize the information so that the
          accomplishments of the athletes become clear and therefore attract
          potential sponsors. The intended audience for this webpage is going to
          be mainly sponsors but also the general public who are eager to know
          more about this families shooting ability. For the sponsors it would
          be necessary to see if the different members of the Hembre family has
          achieved something remarkable, like gotten medals or broken records.
          This can be showed by statistics and also videos. For the general
          public the pictures, videos and statistics seem interesting.

        <h3 id="navigation">Navigation Structure</h3>
        <p class="infoP">
          The structure of Team Hembres website is to be both linear and
          hierarchical as the navigation-bar offers a course to each “main”
          page, as well as a dropdown-menu (also located on the navbar) linked
          to the pages of the team members. Each athlete has three subpages of
          their own which displays individual “best of” stats, as well as a
          dropdown-menu with a list of links to attended competitions throughout
          their career. These subpages are naturally only available through
          their own respective pages, and is the only information that is not
          reachable from every page throughout the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual presentation of the structure:
          <img
            id="struktur"
            style="width: 100%;"
            src="./structure.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          The reasoning behind this structure is to make the information about
          the athletes as accessbile and as attractive as possible for the
          purpsoe of convinving potential sponsors and donors. By connecting
          most of the pages with general information in the navbar, the user
          will find it easy to move around on the website and navigating to
          their desired information. The subpages are isloated to not confuse
          the user with statistics about the wrong athlete.

          We choose a professional look because we want the website tho look as formal

          to because the audience is very wide and there are many elderly
          people that doesn't know computers well.
          So we focused on having an easily navigatable navigation-bar width some
          dropdown-elements so you can navigate where you want from every page since
          every pages have a navigation-bar.

        <p>There will be 21 separate pages as follows:</p>

        <p>
          the homepage: the homepage will be the first webpage the user sees.
          This is why we want to make it easy for the user to navigate with a
          navigation bar. We also want the consumer to see the lates news about
          the Hembre family with a slide show they can click on to get to the
          news. It will also have buttons to go back or forward. Under the News
          slide you will find a square with all the 4 athletes so you can go in
          on their personal site for more information about them easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          navigation bar: the navigation bar will be made up off the logo,
          about, historie, kontakt oss, sponorer og Utdøverne. If you hover over
          the utdøvere link you will get a dropdownmenu with all the four
          athletes with the underlying pages for each of them which are: their
          own personal page, beste resultat, gjennomsnitt, ant starter.
        </p>
        <p>
          the logo: the logo will be made with svg for the best quality. It will
          say Hembre or Team hembre. When you hover over the navigation bar it
          will change to say home or hjem so its easier for the user to get to
          the homepage.

              the website. This way we can also prevent repetitive code. The
              function will handle the timing and button presses to skip images.

          </li>
          <li>

              will have a form where you can contact the site-administration.
              Since we wont use databases, the function will only validate the

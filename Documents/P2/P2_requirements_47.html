        <p>
          Pål explained to us that the purpose of the website is to attract
          sponsors to further his and his 3 sons carreers as shooting athletes.
          Our goal is to structure and prioritize the information so that the
          accomplishments of the athletes become clear and therefore attract
          potential sponsors. The intended audience for this webpage is going to
          be mainly sponsors but also the general public who are eager to know
          more about this families shooting ability. For the sponsors it would
          be necessary to see if the different members of the Hembre family has
          achieved something remarkable, like gotten medals or broken records.
          This can be showed by statistics and also videos. For the general
          public the pictures, videos and statistics seem interesting.

        <h3 id="navigation">Navigation Structure</h3>
        <p class="infoP">
          The structure of Team Hembres website is to be both linear and
          hierarchical as the navigation-bar offers a course to each “main”
          page, as well as a dropdown-menu (also located on the navbar) linked
          to the pages of the team members. Each athlete has three subpages of
          their own which displays individual “best of” stats, as well as a
          dropdown-menu with a list of links to attended competitions throughout
          their career. These subpages are naturally only available through
          their own respective pages, and is the only information that is not
          reachable from every page throughout the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual presentation of the structure:
          <img
            id="struktur"
            style="width: 100%;"
            src="./structure.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          The reasoning behind this structure is to make the information about
          the athletes as accessbile and as attractive as possible for the
          purpsoe of convinving potential sponsors and donors. By connecting
          most of the pages with general information in the navbar, the user
          will find it easy to move around on the website and navigating to
          their desired information. The subpages are isloated to not confuse
          the user with statistics about the wrong athlete.

        <h3 id="page_layout">Page Layout and Apperance</h3>
        <p class="infoP">
          We choose a professional look because we want the website tho look as formal
          as possible.
          And we also focused especially that the website where very easy to navigate
          to because the audience is very wide and there are many elderly
          people that doesn't know computers well.
          So we focused on having an easily navigatable navigation-bar width some
          dropdown-elements so you can navigate where you want from every page since
          every pages have a navigation-bar.
        </p>
        <p class="infoP">
            in the navigation-bar there is a tab with athletes called "utøvere" width a dropdownmenu
            thath showcases the athletes and i you hover over the athletes a new dropdownmenu
            apears so if you want to go right to the statistics if your desire source
        </p>
        <p class="infoP">
            there is also a tab that leads you to the news called "nyheter".
            And one tab that leads you to the about us called "om oss"

    </div>
        
        
    <div class="flexBox">
      <h3 id="content">Content </h3>

      <p>
        Hereunder we will explain what is going to be displayed on each page of the website. There will be 21 individual pages in total, but some of these are bundled together because they have the same layout. The websites color palette is going to
        stay consistent throughout most of the pages as we opted for cold” colors in the background, and some warmer colors in the foreground, so that clickables and other more important aspects pop more out of the page.
      </p>
      <h3> Homepage - index.html </h3>
      <p>
        The homepage will be the first webpage the user sees. Therefore, we want to make it easy and intuitive for the user to navigate with a navigation bar. The navigation bar will be located on the top of the page and will contain the following
        buttons: logo, om oss (about us), kontakt oss (contact us), sponsorer (sponsors) and utøvere (athletes). Each button will take the user to a different page and when users hover over the “utøvere”-button they will get a dropdown menu with
        links to the underlying pages for each individual athlete. The navigation bar is the same on all the following pages and the logo will be usable as a home button for easy backtracking to the homepage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our client wants the homepage to include pictures, videos, news, sponsors and supporting players. Because of that, the homepage is going to be split vertically into three sections. The far left of the page will feature the logos of Team
        Hembres´ sponsors, which will also be clickable links that bring the user to the sponsors´ own websites. The far right of the page will include a list of all of Team Hemres´supporting players. As for the middle, we want to include a lot of
        interesting news about Team Hembre, and we believe that the most space-efficient way to do that is with an interactive slideshow where the user can choose to go back and forth. Underneath this slideshow we will have a section with pictures
        of all the 4 athletes and their respective names. The user will be able to click on these pictures for easy navigation to each individual athletes’ personal site. Right above the footer there will be another slideshow with different videos
        of Team Hembre participating in events or other related material.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like the navigation bar, the footer will be the same for every page. The footer consists of the logo, links to the individual athletes, the “kontakt oss”-button, Pål Hembres´ personal contact information and a link to the national
        shooting statistics.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/index.png" alt="">
      <h3> Sponsorer - sponsors.html </h3>
      <p>
        The sponsor page will feature more information on the teams´sponsors. This page is meant to market the sponsors, as well as to thank them for their support. At the top of the page their logos will be featured and users who click on the logos
        will be taken further down on the page where more information about the sponsor is given. Here the page will have a link to external sponsor-pages as well. This page will also veer a little from the color pallet chosen for the other pages,
        which we believe will be a nice mix up, and will differentiate the page a little since it will be the only page not focused on Team Hembre. This page will also fulfil the goal of showing odd the sponsors more than just on the front page and give them the recognition Pål Hembre asked for.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/sponsor.png" alt="">


      <h3> Nyheter – news.html </h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of the news page will be to update the user of recent happenings, be it competitive results or other interesting developments at Team Hembre. At the top of this page we will have the same slideshow as seen on the homepage, but it
        will however be possible to post news stories with a little more context further down the page.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/nyheter.png" alt="">


      <h3> Om oss – about.html </h3>
      <p>
        The about us page will consist mostly of information about Team Hembre as a whole, to give the user some backstory on how this organization came to be. A team photo will be located at the top of the page and below that there will be a box
        that displays Team Hembres´ merits collectively. Further down there will be some informational text about the entire organization, as well as some short texts that serves as an introduction to each member individually.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/om.png" alt="">


      <h3> Kontakt oss - contact.html </h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this page is mainly to be a way for potential sponsors or supporting players to get in touch with the team. The page will give the user the option to leave a message by filling in a small form. Underneath the form there will be
        information on where the team practices. Here we will put the address and phone number, as well as a map showing the location of the training facilities.
        Right over the footer we will also show the sponsors´ logos again.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/kontakt.png" alt="">

      <h3> Utøvere </h3>
      <p>
        - paal.html
        - mattis.html
        - ludvik.html
        - tim_leo.html
      </p>
      <p>
        The individual pages for each athlete will have the same layout. These pages are meant to give the user more information about each of the athletes and highlight their accomplishments in the sport. On the top-left side of the page we will
        put a picture of the athlete in question, and on the top-right there will be more generic information like age and years of experience. Here we will also put a dropdown menu that shows a selection of different events the athlete has
        participated in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further down on the page we will have a couple of boxes, showing the athletes merits and their personal best scores. These pages will also contain links to the respective athletes’ best competitive result, their average score and number of
        starts. These pages will only be showing one table that covers the whole page, so while they will be individual to each athlete, they will still have the exact same layout.
      </p>
      <img src="../bilder/mattis_side.png" alt="">


      <h3> Beste resultat </h3>
      <p>
        - paal_beste.html

        - ludvik_beste.html
        - tim_leo_beste.html
      </p>

        These pages will display a table that shows the athletes best scores this in all the different events the last few years.
      </p>

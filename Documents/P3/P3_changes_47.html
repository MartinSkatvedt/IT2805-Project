      <h3 id="changes">Changes we have made</h3>

      <h4>changes all around:</h4>
      <p>
        As we expected, our final website did not completely align with the mock up and plan made in P2 of this webpage.
        Our plan from P2 was to make 21 different pages, but we luckily found a more efficient way to display the statistics
        of the current athletes with the use of javascript.
        Therefore there are only 6 html sites and 10 javascript files instead.
        With the use of javascript objects it will also be easier to edit and create additional athletes in the future,
        which was a requirement made by the client.
        The intent behind this is to make for a more fluid experince for the user aswell as the developer (the client),
        and provide a more elegant look with less room for error or variation in pages that should be alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        A problem wich affected the page negatively is the lack of images, videos and athletes information that we got.
        We have also made it really easy to add new members like Pål Hembre's youngest son who will maybe start
        shooting profesionally
        soon.
        Hereunder we will go through each page, the changes that have been made on them our reasoning on why we made these changes.
        We also spoke with Pål who changed his mind about the language on the webpage being Norwegian, likely to make the page more available to international sponsors,
        so we translated the page to english.
      </p>
      <h4>main and body changes:</h4>
      <p>
        After the first round of feedback from users we decided to change the background-color of main and body
        to make it look more proffesional because we agreed that the colour combination wasn't optimal.
        Then we ran the rest of the tests with the new colors, which turned out to be more enjoyable.
        We also made all the margins of the main-elements to be the same to make the page more streamlined,
        as well as to give the impression of a more unified and coordinated page.

      </p>
      <h4>link colour</h4>
      <p> We delliberately chose to not change the colour of the links because studies show that elderly
        perople which there are a lot of in profesional
        shooting tend to understand that the blue colour is a link. Another reason is that people
        with colour vision deficiency almost never have a colour blue deficiency.
        (https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-hyperlinks-are-blue/)</p>
      <h4>front page:</h4>
      <p>
        The Front page is almost the same as we imagined, just a bit simpler and more symetrical.
        First of all, we agreed with Pål that the bottom part of the page where there was going to be
        a videoslideshow would be unnecessary, as Pål didnt really have any good quality videos of the athlethes.
        We also chose to use a smaller width for the main part of the index site because users felt overhvelmed
        with information and that a bit of breathing room on the sides would be better. We also adde the headline news so users can more easily understand what is happening after som good feedback.
        We also added som more mock suporiting players as we don't know how many there will be on the real page.
      </p>
      <h4>about us site:</h4>
      <p>We figured that the original plan for the about us page was somewhat boring with just some
        simple information about the athletes. So we made the page interactive with some links and additional pictures.
        We also added a seperate "scroll-box" (dont know what to call it), which allows the user to scroll through
        the current athletes, displaying a mini-version of their own subpages. We also made a bit more room on the sides
        as the feedback from users indicated that it was required to make the page lighter and easier to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        We choose a bit lighter camel colour for the background to empashize the text and images.
        Instead of having
        long paragraphs we chose short sentences which are similar made for all the athletes so its easy
        for the viewer to find the information they need.
      </p>
      <h4>navigation bar:</h4>
      <p>
        The navigation bar is pretty similar, besides the changed language and instead of an overline,
        there is an underline, because it was easier to understand.
        We chose to change the font for the navigation bar because according to Aaron Kitney
        (https://makeawebsitehub.com/best-safe-web-fonts-html-css/)
        , the font Arial is a great friendly font for interactive webpages and it is universal, so any browser
        and device wont have poblems interpretting it.

      </p>

      <h4>footer:</h4>
      <p>
        The footer is pretty similar to what we imagined, the only real big differences are the change of the style
        for the contact us button and the new backgound colour which made the page look more proffesional and of course setting the follow us button in the midle of the footer. The follow us button was originally only shown on about us and wasn't so
        visible so we chose to set it somwhere with better visibility like the footer. Pål said we only needed to connect to their
        facebook site, but that it didnt need to take up so much space, instead of linkedin, twitter, etc.
      </p>
      <h4>contact us site:</h4>
      <p>
        We made a few changes to the contact page. First of all, we decided to remove the sponsors´ logos as we feel this is a bit cleaner than our first draft was.
        We also didn’t find it necessary to have a CAPTCHA in the form and chenged the backgound color of the form for it to look more proffesional.
        Other than that, the page layout is pretty much the same with the contact form taking up most of the page, and a couple of boxes underneath.
        One containing a map that pins the training facilities location as well as a box with the address, e-mail and phone number.
      </p>

      <h4>Logo:</h4>
      <p>The logo we have made is a svg which makes it usuable in all sizes and it uses the Hembre slogan "Med gull i sikte" which weren't in our intial thought but makes it look muche better especially since it's a svg. </p>

      <h4>news site:</h4>
      <p>The news page ended up looking fairly similar to what we had planned, besides the change of color combination for the background and element-background.
        We decided to remove the slideshow from this page as it was already prominently featured on the homepage and it felt a little repetitive being above the news boxes.
        Instead we went for a simpler page, where relevant news about the athletes are shown in separate boxes.
        Having the boxes linked to scripts in data.js has made it really easy to add and remove boxes at will, and also makes it easy to change the text and images inside.
      </p>
      <h4>sponsor site:</h4>
      <p>The layout of the sponsors page came out a bit diiferent to what we had planned, although we did decide to
        make the colors of the sponsor grid a little more moderate as we felt this fit in more with the site.
        We also added some neat functions that we didn’t specify in the last part like onclicks and links to the sites.
        The sponsors´ logos that are located at the upper part of the page do still take the user
        further down to an informational text about the given company, but now the logos also hover which
        makes the site feel a little more alive and interacvtive. When clicking the sponsors information-boxes
        you get redirected to their homepage
      </p>
      <h4>athlete pages:</h4>
      <p>The athlete pages has gone from being 4 different pages to only one for several reasons.
        First of all it makes it that easier to add a new athlete like Pål's youngest son who hasn't started yet.
        It also makes the coding for the different athlethes sites much simpler.
        The skyttere.html doesnt actually have any html coding because it is all made in shooters.js instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we look at the design of the site we chose to change it a lot to make it more efficient and esthetic.
        Instead of making the site så long we choose to show as much information in the upper section so you don't
        need to do so much scrolling. we also chose to not add the images and videos so because Pål said he
        didn't have enough pictures or videos so it would be unnecessary.

      </p>
      <h4>underlying pages for each athelete:</h4>
      <p>Instead of making a underlying page for all the different stats we choose to make it link to the stats that are on Pål's old page because that is what Pål thought was the best way. This was also done in script to easier change it all the
        places its used. </p>

      <h4>slideshow for front page:</h4>
      <p>The Slideshow for the front page is directly connected to the news site through slideshowhjem.js.
        This makes it possible to click on a slide and get directed to the news. We have also made it easy to
        just add a new news in data.js
      </p>

      <h4>Mobile responsive sites:</h4>
      <p>Instead of making a hamburger menu for the navigation bar in the mobile responsive version,
        we chose to just decrease the font size and the height of the nav bar. After the testing,
        the users who chose to use a phone did not have any complaints.
      </p>
      <p>
        The footer also changed to show the most possible information, therefore we choose to have the
        subpages for each athlete.
      </p>

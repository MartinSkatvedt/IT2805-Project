      <h3 id="changes">Changes we have made</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>changes all around:</h4>
        As we expected, our final website did not completely align with the mock up and plan made in P2 of this webpage.
        Our plan from P2 was to make 21 different pages, but we luckily found a way more efficient way to show all the information we needed to get out by using javascript. Therefore there are only 6 html sites, but 10 javascript files instead. Most
        of the changes done are for a more efficient and better looking website or because of requests from Pål Hembre the client..
        Because of this we decided to make some changes that we feel give the website a cleaner look and a more fluid user experience. It is also now much easier to add information, shooters, sponsors, etc, which was a requirement for the client.
      </p>
      <p>
        A problem wich affected the page negatively is the lack of images, videos and Athlethe information that we got. We have also made it really easy to add new members like Pål Hembre youngest son who will maybe start shooting profesionally
        soon.
        Hereunder we will go through each page, the changes that have been made on them our reasoning on why we made these changes. We also talked with Pål who changed his mind about the language the site should be in, so we had to change it to
        english.

        <h4>main and body colour changes:</h4>
        <p>
          After the first feedback from a user we decided to change the colours of the backgound of main and body to make in look more proffesional because we agreed that the colour combination wasn't that good. After that we tested it to the rest
          of the testers who liked the colours.

        </p>

        <h4>front page:</h4>
        <p>
          The Front page is almost the same as we imagined, just a bit simpler and more symetrical. First of all, we agreed with Pål that the bottome part of the page where there was going to be a videoslideshow would be unnecessary and hard to make
          because Pål didnt have so many good quality videos of the athlethes.
        </p>
        <h4>about us site:</h4>
        <p>The About us page changed a bit, we figured out that the long page, looked a bit boring, so we made it a bit more interactive. First of all we put in a lot of images to make it a bit more interesting. Instead of continuing the same style
          for the rest of the family we choose a new form of display. Each person gets their on box wich gives most of the important information about the athelthes and links to either statistics or the athelthes personal website with even more
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We choose a bit lighter camel colour for the background to empashize the text and images. We delliberately chose to noe change the colour of the links because studies show that elderly perople which there are a lot of in profesional
          shooting tend to understand that the blue colour is a link. Another reason is that people with colour vision deficiency almost never have a colour blue deficiency.(https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-hyperlinks-are-blue/) Instead of having
          long paragraphs we chose short sentences which are similar made for all the athletes so its easy for the viewer to find the information they need. Pål said we only needed to connect to their facebook site, but that it didnt need to take up
          so much space, instead of linkedin, twitter, etc.
        </p>
        <h4>navigation bar:</h4>
        <p>
          The navigation bar is pretty similar, besides the changed language and instead og a overline, there is a black underline, because it was easier to understand.
          We chose to change the font for the navigation bar because according to Aaron Kitney
          (https://makeawebsitehub.com/best-safe-web-fonts-html-css/)
          , Therefore we changed the font to Arial, which is a great friendly font for interactive webpages.

        </p>

        <h4>footer:</h4>
        <p>
          The footer is pretty similar to what we imagined, the only real big differences are the change of the style for the contact us button and the new backgound colour which made the page look more proffesional.
        </p>
        <h4>contact us site:</h4>
        <p>
          We made a few changes to the contact page. First of all, we decided to remove the sponsors´ logos as we feel this is a bit cleaner than our first draft was.
          We also didn’t find it necessary to have a CAPTCHA in the form.
          Other than that, the page layout is pretty much the same with the contact form taking up most of the page, and a couple of boxes underneath.
          One containing a map that pins the training facilities location as well as a box with the address, e-mail and phone number.
        </p>

        <h4>Logo:</h4>
        <p>The logo we have made is a svg which makes it usuable in all sizes and it uses the Hembre slogan "Med gull i sikte". </p>

        <h4>news site:</h4>
        <p>The news page ended up looking fairly similar to what we had planned, besides the change of colou combination for the background and element-background.
          We decided to remove the slideshow from this page as it was already prominently featured on the homepage and it felt a little repetitive being above the news boxes.
          Instead we went for a simpler page, where relevant news about the athletes are shown in separate boxes.
          Having the boxes linked to scripts in data.js has made it really easy to add and remove boxes at will, and also makes it easy to change the text and images inside.
        </p>
        <h4>sponsor site:</h4>
        <p>The layout of the sponsors page came out very similar to what we had planned, although we did decide to make the colors of the sponsor grid a little more moderate as we felt this fit in more with the site.
          We also added some neat functions that we didn’t specify in the last part.
          The sponsors´ logos that are located at the upper part of the page do still take the user further down to an informational text about the given company, but now the logos also hover which makes the site feel a little more alive and interacvtive.
        </p>
        <h4>athlete pages:</h4>
<p>The athlete pages has gone from being 4 different pages to only one for several different reason. First of all it makes it so much easier to add a new athlete like Pål's youngest son who hasn't started yet. It also makes the coding for the different athlethes sites much simpler. The skyttere.html doesnt actually have any html coding because it is all made in shooters.js instead.</p>
 <p>
When we look at the design of the site we choose to change it a lot to make it more efficient and esthetic. Instead of making the site så long we choose to show as much information in the upper section so you don't need to do so much scrolling. we also chose to not add the images and videso because Pål said he didn't have enough pictures or videos so it would be unnecessary.

 </p>
        <h4>underlying pages for each athelete:</h4>
        <p>Instead of making a underlying page for all the different stats we choose to make it link to the stats that are on Pål's old page because that is what Pål thought was the best way. This was also done in script. to easier change it all the places its used. </p>
        <h4>slideshow for front page:</h4>
        <p>The Slideshow for the front page is directly connected to the news site through slideshowhjem.js. This does so you can click on a slide ang get straight to the news. We have also made it easy to just add a new news in data.js</p>
        <h4>Mobile responsive navigation bar:</h4>
        <p>Instead of making a hamburger menu for the navigation bar in the mobile responsive version, we chosse to just lower the font size and the height of the nav bar. After the testing, the users who chose to open on the phone did not have any complaints.  </p>
      </p>

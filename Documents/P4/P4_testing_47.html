      <h3>Testing process</h3>

        <h4 id="testing-document"> Testing Document:</h4>
        <p>
        To gather user rewievs be decided to both ceate a Google form that we could easily distribute to several users and also observe a few user as they tested the site for the first time.
        The google form was helfull in that it allowed us to hgather a large amount of feedback that we then could compare to find the most pressing issues with our website
        We did this because we believe this was the most efficient way to gather as much feedback as possible. Our thought process in creating the form was to focus on getting the users overall impression of the website without overwhelming them with a overly long questionaire.
        Therefore we decided to make the form consist of a total of twentyone questions divided in to five main sections.
        The questions we gave were fairly broad as we believed this gave the user more of a chance to mention any issues they met.
        <ol>
            <p>About you: This section of the form was just created to get a little information about the user.
                This includes the users age range, the users experience within IT and what device the user was on during testing </p>
            <p>Aesthetics: This section focused on the users first impretion of the site and what he or she (or other) thought about the layout and color scheme.</p>
            <p>Navigation: This section focused on the users thoughts about navigating through the website an how intuitive it was for new users to move from site to site.  </p>
            <p>Layout/placement: This section focused on the placement of the information and if the user felt that the placement of the different information was located nicely on individual sites.
                This goes hand in hand with the navigation as it gives us an idea if the website is intuitively stuctured and the information i where the user expects it to be.</p>
        </ol>

        <p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaEWtAQyYcpzu_HCNKP7XIPOQJno_mVms1P4eitM9d-69v4Q/viewform?fbclid=IwAR0xqkOG9AZm_1y-WXHgRIUDOM5p1bStKn5pEBPom9E05ux2wMRz9kp_wuU" target=_blank>Link to Google form</a>
        </p>

        <p>
        Observing a few people using the website for the first time also gave great insight.
        We tried not to give the user any instructions and only spoke when being directly asked about something.
        The point of this was to actually see and hear the first impresion of a user and, se how they interacted with, and used, the site.
        </p>
    </p>

        <h4 id="tester-audience">Tester Audience:</h4>
        <p>
        We had a total of 17 answers on our google form which we think is plenty to get a nice grasp of what the 
        </p>
        <p>
        The tester audience varies in age from under 19 to over 50, thought the majority of our testers span the age 20 to 29. 
        This is expected as our networks mainly consist of users in our own range group, but we could have done more to diversify the tester audience since we expect the average age the target audience to be slightly higher.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The tester audience did however stike a nice balance between male and female users 
        </p>
        
        for the website  women and men as you can se in the charts under.

        <p>
        In our form we included questions about what device and what webbrowser was used during the users testing of the website.
        All together we experienced that a majority of the users that tested the site used smartphones. Luckiley there were not any significant problems with that.

<p>The feedback was quite </p>

        <p>Some of the changes we have made because of the feedback is changing colours, making css for all sites more similar, making the pages more spacious and changed the language to English.</p>
        <p>In the future we would like to make even more changes for instance by making a hamburger navigation bar when your using your phone. We would also like to use database to make the contact form actually useful.  </p>

        <h4 id="reflection">Self-reflection:</h4>
        <p>
            In reflecting over the entire project process, one quote from George Washington comes to mind: «Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors.».
            We have definitely committed many errors, and with the power of hindsight we are more able to see where we went wrong. Although we proudly submit our website, it now becomes all the more apparent what improvements we could make. When it comes to our own defects, we are now more aware of our lack of experience in web design and that we have a lot to learn, especially when it comes to our stylistic choices.
            However, in reflecting on our own work we have also realized that we have made some solid improvements, as coders and as a group.

            The great thing about mistakes is that you learn from them, and we will not look back on our previous decisions as lost opportunities, but rather as gained experiences. And these are experiences we will take with into future projects.

            This reflective part may read as a pandering after school special, but we genuinely feel that this project has made us stronger on both a technical level and a collaborative level.
        </p>

        <p> We would like to close of with a few concrete examples of what we would have done differently, and probably will do differently in the future:</p>
        <ul>
        <p>We could have had some potential users have a look at the planned layout and maybe modified it a little before starting the actual coding process.</p>
        <p>We could have gotten more proffesional shooters to test the sites because they would probably go on the site more and would maybe understand he content better.</p>
        <p>We could have </p>

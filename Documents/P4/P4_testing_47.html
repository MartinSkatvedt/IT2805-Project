        To gather user rewievs be decided to both ceate a Google form that we could easily distribute to several users and also observe a few user as they tested the site for the first time.
        The google form was helfull in that it allowed us to hgather a large amount of feedback that we then could compare to find the most pressing issues with our website 
        We did this because we believe this was the most efficient way to gather as much feedback as possible. Our thought process in creating the form was to focus on getting the users overall impression of the website without overwhelming them with a overly long questionaire.
        Therefore we decided to make the form consist of a total of twentyone questions divided in to five main sections. 
        The questions we gave were fairly broad as we believed this gave the user more of a chance to mention any issues they met.
        <ol>
            <p>About you: This section of the form was just created to get a little information about the user. 
                This includes the users age range, the users experience within IT and what device the user was on during testing </p>
            <p>Aesthetics: This section focused on the users first impretion of the site and what he or she (or other) thought about the layout and color scheme.</p>
            <p>Navigation: This section focused  </p>
            <p>Layout/placement: This section focused on the placement of the information and if the user felt that the placement of the different information was located nicely on individual sites. 
                This goes hand in hand with the navigation as it gives us an idea if the website is intuitively stuctured and the information i where the user expects it to be.</p>

        In our form we included questions about what device and what webbrowser was used during the users testing of the website.
        All together we experienced that a majority of the users that tested the site used smartphones

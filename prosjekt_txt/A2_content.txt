the homepage:
the homepage will be the first webpage the user sees.
This is why we want to make it easy for the user to navigate with a navigation bar.
We also want the consumer to see the lates news about the Hembre family with a slide show they can click on to get to the news.
It will also have buttons to go  back or forward.
Under the News slide you will find a square with all the 4 athletes so you can go in on their personal site for more information about them easily.


navigation bar:
the navigation bar will be made up off the logo, about, historie, kontakt oss, sponorer og Utdøverne.
If you hover over the utdøvere link you will get a dropdownmenu with all the four athletes with the underlying pages for each of them which are:
their own personal page, beste resultat, gjennomsnitt, ant starter.


the logo:
the logo will be made with svg for the best quality. It will say Hembre or Team hembre.
When you hover over the navigation bar it will change to say home or hjem so its easier for the user to get to the homepage.
